        Hi, I'm Alexis Rappa
        <br>
        Engineer. Developer. Rocket Scientist.

        <p>Fully committed to the philosophy of life-long learning, I’m a computer engineering student at Texas A&M University with a deep passion for electronics, rockets, software development, and all things with electrons. The unique combination of creativity, logic, technology and never running out of new things to discover, drives my excitement and passion for engineering. When I’m not at my computer I like to spend my time reading, keeping fit and playing soccer.</p>
